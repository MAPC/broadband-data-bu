# Datasets
## Measurement Lab (M-Lab) Data

>Measurement Lab (M-Lab) provides the largest collection of open Internet performance data on the planet. As a consortium of research, industry, and public-interest partners, M-Lab is dedicated to providing an ecosystem for the open, verifiable measurement of global network performance.

We have used M-Lab data in Dec 2020 [DataCommon visulization](https://datacommon.mapc.org/calendar/2020/december). As of yet M-Lab data is not upload as a table or spatial dataset to DataCommon. Doing so at end of project would be a goal. The full data is available on [Google BigQuery here](https://www.measurementlab.net/data/). You can contribute to the dataset through the google widget or with a test [here](https://speed.measurementlab.net/#/).

Our initial data pull for a few towns can be found in the [repository here](https://github.com/MAPC/broadband-data/tree/main/data). The scripts we used are also in that [repository here](https://github.com/MAPC/broadband-data/tree/main/processors). The by provider, by year for three communities we are working with can be [found here](https://airtable.com/shr4YlB9Ps9MM8qCw).


## Ookla Data
>Speedtest Intelligence offers up-to-date insights into global fixed broadband and mobile performance data based on millions of consumer-initiated tests taken every day with SpeedtestÂ®.

## Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Data
[FCC coverage map](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/#/) This is the map with [funds](https://www.wiley.law/alert-Congress-Provides-Nearly-7-Billion-in-New-Broadband-Funding-in-the-Latest-COVID-19-Stimulus-Legislation) on way to [improve the map](https://statescoop.com/fcc-adopts-new-broadband-data-mapping-rules/) 

FCC data can be [found here](https://opendata.fcc.gov/). Have included in repository fixed broadband coverage from 477 forms for MA-Fixed-Jun2019.


## DataCommon and Census Data
There are many datasets available for the Census that may prove interesting for further analysis in this project. You can browse and download Census data for Massachusetts on [DataCommon](https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser) or the full list on [Data.Census](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). Visualization to note on DataCommon a map looking at the Census question "Households without a computing device": [The Digital Divide and the 2020 Census](https://datacommon.mapc.org/calendar/2020/april).
